  - The motivation for this project was to learn how to interact with Render and GitHub actions in a way that allows the developer to have branch protection at different stages in the development process.
  - I built this project to learn how to interact with Render and GitHub actions in a way that is more efficient and effective for development and deployment purposes.
  - This project solves the problem of errors making their way out of development and into the production branch.
  - I learned how to interact with GitHub actions through the respective YAML files that communicate with the repository to run tests and when to run them.
